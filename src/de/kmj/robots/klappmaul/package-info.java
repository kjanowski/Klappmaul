/**
 * Provides a software agent named "Klappmaul" which is used to
 * develop and test the RobotEngine framework.
 * <p>
 * The Klappmaul mimicks various design aspects of the robots used at HCM Lab 
 * (Robopec Reeti, RoboKind R-50, Aldebaran NAO),
 * such as distributing the functionality across separately accessible services
 * or providing only limited feedback on command execution.
 * <p>
 * Consequently, the Klappmaul serves to demonstrate various
 * those programming approaches which apply to several different robot types.
 * <p>
 * This package consists of two parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The "black box" API is the equivalent to the libraries supplied
 * by a robot's manufacturer.</li>
 * <li> The RobotEngine implementation for the Klappmaul which is intended
 * as a tutorial for creating the other RobotEngines. </li>
 * </ul>
